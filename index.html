							<li class="faq">
								<p><strong> I am interested in doing research with you. What are the next steps?</strong><br />
                                    First of all, I must note that I am not a research faculty member of UW.
                                    That means that any work done with me will not be for credit and cannot be funded through UW.
                                    If you are interested in hacking on hard problems and gaining hands on experience,
                                    I am accepting students to work with me on a variety of projects.
                                    Please stop by office hours or email me directly to discuss.
							</li>
							<li class="faq">
								<p><strong> Would you write me a letter of recommendation?</strong><br />
                                    Letters of recommendation are a quid pro quo. I cannot write a worthwhile 
                                    letter for you based only on your in class participation and grade. Therefore,
                                    I have all students who want a letter of recommendation work with me on a micro-project.
                                    This project can vary in scope, topic and difficulty. 
                                    Please stop by office hours or email me directly to discuss.

							<li class="faq">
								<p><strong> What is course XYZ about? What will we cover? Is there a syllabus?</strong><br />
                                    Stop by on syllabus day to learn more.
