				<p>
					I am a vibe coder. Here's what that means and how I got here.
				</p>

				<h2>The Beginning: Copilot and Joy</h2>
				<p>
					I started vibe coding with GitHub Copilot back in 2023, and the impact was immediate.
					The biggest change wasn't productivity or speed—it was enjoyment. Coding became more fun.
				</p>
				<p>
					This was especially true when writing Python scripts for data processing. The boilerplate
					that used to feel like a chore became fast and effortless. Suddenly, the overall experience
					of "coding" was just... better. I could focus on the interesting parts.
				</p>

				<h2>A Year as a Vibe Coding CTO</h2>
				<p>
					For the past year, I've been full-on vibe coding as a CTO. Not as an experiment—as my
					primary mode of building.
				</p>
				<p>
					My role as CTO is primarily that of a product manager for the entire company. And here's
					the thing: the way I interact with AI assistants isn't entirely different from how I
					interact with my engineers.
				</p>
				<p>
					We set goals. We explore the space together. We talk through the plan. They execute.
					We review together. Rinse and repeat.
				</p>
				<p>
					<!-- Add more thoughts on the CTO workflow, what's different, what's the same -->

				<h2>What I've Built</h2>
