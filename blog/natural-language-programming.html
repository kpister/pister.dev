					Vibe coding is the new paradigm of programming. Like functional and object-oriented
					programming that came before it, vibe coding has foundational units which define its
					interactions and set its capabilities.
				</p>

				<h2>Paradigms and Their Primitives</h2>
				<p>
					Every programming paradigm is built on a fundamental primitive. That primitive shapes
					everything that follows—the patterns that emerge, the problems it solves well, the
					way programmers think.
				</p>

				<h3>Functional Programming: The Function</h3>
				<p>
					The core tenet of functional programming is the function.
				</p>
				<p>
					First-class functions naturally lead to recursion and higher-order functions.
					Recursion naturally leads to immutability. Functions benefit from static typing,
					leading to evolved type systems.
				</p>
				<pre><code>function → first-class functions
         → recursion
         → higher-order functions
         → immutability
         → static typing
         → advanced type systems</code></pre>
				<p>
					<!-- Add more on how functions shaped FP's evolution -->
				</p>

				<h3>Object-Oriented Programming: The Object</h3>
				<p>
					OOP is built from objects.
				</p>
				<p>
					Objects lead to inheritance and subtyping. Inheritance leads to dynamic lookup.
					These paradigms are built on their most fundamental component.
				</p>
				<pre><code>object → encapsulation
       → inheritance
       → subtyping
       → polymorphism
       → dynamic dispatch</code></pre>
				<p>
					<!-- Add more on how objects shaped OOP's evolution -->
				</p>

				<h2>Natural Language Programming: Code Generation</h2>
				<p>
					Central to vibe coding is the code generation capability of language models.
				</p>
				<p>
					Generative coding leads to dynamic execution. Dynamic execution leads to custom experience.
					These are the core tenets of Natural Language Programming.
				</p>
				<pre><code>code generation → dynamic execution
               → custom experience
               → ???</code></pre>

				<h3>Code Generation</h3>
				<p>
					<!-- What does it mean for code generation to be the primitive? -->
					<!-- Code is no longer static artifact but dynamic output -->
					<!-- The prompt becomes the program -->
				</p>

				<h3>Dynamic Execution</h3>
				<p>
					<!-- Code generated at runtime -->
					<!-- Programs that write programs -->
					<!-- Adaptation to context -->
				</p>

				<h3>Custom Experience</h3>
				<p>
					<!-- Every user gets personalized code/behavior -->
					<!-- Software that adapts to its user -->
					<!-- The end of one-size-fits-all -->
				</p>

				<h2>What Follows?</h2>
				<p>
					<!-- If FP's function led to type systems... -->
					<!-- If OOP's object led to design patterns... -->
					<!-- What does NLP's code generation lead to? -->
				</p>
				<p>
					<!-- Speculation on emerging patterns -->
					<!-- New abstractions we haven't named yet -->
					<!-- The tools and practices that will emerge -->
				</p>

				<h2>Implications</h2>
				<p>
					<!-- What does this mean for how we teach programming? -->
					<!-- What does this mean for how we build software? -->
					<!-- What does this mean for who can build software? -->
				</p>

				<h3>For Education</h3>
				<p>
					<!-- CS 639: Natural Language Programming -->
					<!-- Teaching the paradigm, not just the tools -->
				</p>

				<h3>For Industry</h3>
				<p>
					<!-- How companies should think about this shift -->
				</p>

				<h3>For Developers</h3>
				<p>
					<!-- What skills matter in this paradigm? -->
					<!-- Communication over syntax -->
				</p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					<!-- Bring it back to paradigms -->
					<!-- We're at the beginning of understanding this -->
					<!-- The patterns will emerge as we build -->
